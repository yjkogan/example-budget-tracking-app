Chicago Women Developers Intro to React
=====================

Scaffolding adapted from [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate).

The minimal dev environment to enable live-editing React components.

### Reading Materials
- [Getting Started guide for React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)
- 

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (and NPM). You can install it fairly easily [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
  Linux can probably install node with `apt-get install`
- (If you're on mac) [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) must be installed in order
  for certain node packages to work. Download Xcode from the above link and then open it once. When
  it asks to install some additional requirements, say yes.

### Running the server
```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Linting

This boilerplate project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```

### Examples
The following examples will lead us through the steps needed to have
a nearly fully functioning budget-tracking application.
